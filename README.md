Contributions to this collection are welcome as standard Github pull requests. Contributors should follow general Ansible and Galaxy best practices, and also adhere to the following:

* Roles should be named and behave as (roles)[https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/role] (eg, kubo-node, lotus-miner), rather than functions or tasks (eg, install-kubo, setup-lotus).
* Run `ansible-lint` against the collection and clean up any warnings or errors
